# IBM/Coursera Data Science Capstone: Predicting Traffic Accident Severity in France 
IBM Data Science Certificate

# Describe project
Determine severity of an accident in France, given road conditions, weather conditions, location of prior accidents and other relevant information

# Objective
The French Police Department has recorded all car accidents from 2005 to 2016, including the relevant information descibed above. Using this historical data, we want to determine in which consitions most traffic accidents occur or are most severe.

# Data Source
The data source was downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/ahmedlahlou/accidents-in-france-from-2005-to-2016
# Algorithms

1. Decision Tree i.e. Random Forest
Random forest, like its name implies, consists of a large number of individual decision trees that operate as an ensemble. Each individual tree in the random forest spits out a class prediction and the class with the most votes becomes our modelâ€™s prediction.
2. Logistic Regression
Logistic Regression is used when the dependent variable(target) is categorical.
3. K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, easy-to-implement supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve both classification and regression problems.
4. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
It is a supervised learning model with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis.
